# Autoregressive-Text-Generation
The project's goal is to generate a paragraph using a frequency dictionary of the next word based on a 3-gram model from the existing e-books collected from the Project Gutenberg digital library. We predict the probabilistic maximum likelihood estimate to generate the subsequent words given an initial prompt.

Follow the Medium article to get the 3gram frequency dictionary of all the books.
