# Autoregressive-Text-Generation
The project's goal is to generate a paragraph using a frequency dictionary of the next word based on a 3-gram model from the existing e-books collected from the Project Gutenberg digital library. We predict the probabilistic maximum likelihood estimate to generate the subsequent words given an initial prompt.
